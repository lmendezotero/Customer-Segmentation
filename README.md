## Description of the project üîä
In this project, we have conducted data analysis to determine whether the machine learning techniques can be used to predict the house pricing for a specific location in the United States. The data sets used in this project have been obtained from a Kaggle competition entitled [House Prices Prediction: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

To achieve it, we formed a working team (bcnDataScience) in the Leaderboard of the Kaggle competition to participate in it and get the best possible result. To do this, we have analyzed the data and created some regressions models based on Logistics Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Artificial Neural Networks.

## Folders Structure & Content üìã
The material contained in this repository is divided into 2 main folders:

### House Prices Prediction üìÇ
Here we store the material with which we have been working most of the life of the project. On one hand, documents with explanations of the challenge and data downloaded from the kaggle platform are available.

On another hand, we have created several Jupyter Notebooks to carry out detailed analysis and visualizations and testing some functionalities and performance of the models generated in python, specially the Logistics Regression and Random Forest. Finally, we have saved the csv and pkl files generated with the different notebooks in various subfolders to classify the information and avoid confusion.

## Project Duration ‚è≥
